/**
 * Long-press menu for a track, in the shape music apps normally use.
 *
 * The account actions lead — rating, playlists, library — because they are
 * what the menu is opened for; the queue and navigation rows below it were
 * always the fallback for "I meant to do something with this song".
 *
 * Everything that writes to the account is hidden outright when [signedIn] is
 * false rather than shown and refused. The same goes for a track that is
 * playing from a local file or a finished download (`song.localUri != null`):
 * rating, playlists, downloading it again and sharing all assume a YouTube
 * identity the file doesn't carry, so those rows drop out regardless of
 * [signedIn].
 *
 * [showSleepTimer] and [onShare] are the player's extras: a sleep timer isn't a
 * property of some row in a list, so it only appears where it means something.
 *
 * [onDownload] is only the *start* of a download — cancelling one and deleting
 * a saved file are answered here, because neither needs anything the caller
 * has. Starting one might: below API 29 it needs a storage permission that only
 * an Activity can ask for.
 *
 * The sheet is frosted like the floating chrome — artwork-tinted fill, hairline
 * edge, real Haze when the host can sample the page behind it — rather than a
 * painted wash that only *looked* like blur. The host supplies no container
 * colour and no drag handle; both are drawn here over the frost.
